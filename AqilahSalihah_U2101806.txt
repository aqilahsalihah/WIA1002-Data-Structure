My name is Aqilah Salihah with matrix number, U2101806. I am
majoring in BCS Data Science. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because I am excited to learn and advance my skills in programming.

I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will do all my tutorial and lab assigned. Wish me luck!!!
